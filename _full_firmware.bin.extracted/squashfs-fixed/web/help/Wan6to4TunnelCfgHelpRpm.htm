<H1>IPv6 WAN Help</H1>
<!--<p><b>WAN Port</b> - The WAN port name  you are going to configure.</p>-->
<p><B>Enable IPv6:</B>Enable or disable the IPv6 feature.</P>
<p><B>WAN Connection Type:</B> </p>
<p>Choosing the correct WAN connection type based on your ISP network topology.</p> 

<ul> 
<lI><B>DHCPv6</B>  - Connections which use dynamic IPv6 address assignment.</li>
<lI><B>Static IPv6</B>  -  Connections which use static IPv6 address assignment.</li>
<lI><B>PPPoEv6</B> - Connections which use PPPoEv6 that requires a user name and password.</li>
<lI><B>Tunnel 6to4</B>  -  Connections which use 6to4 address assignment.</li>
</ul> 

<p><B>IPv6 Address</B> - The IPv6 address assigned by your ISP dynamically.</p>
<P>Click the <B>Renew</B> button to renew the IPv6 parameters from your ISP.
<P>Click the <B>Release</B> button to release the IPv6 parameters from your ISP. 
<p>If your ISP gives you one or two DNS IPv6 addresses, select <B>Use the following IPv6 DNS Servers</B> and enter the <B>Primary IPv6 DNS</B> and <B>Secondary IPv6 DNS</B> into the correct fields. Otherwise, the DNS servers will be assigned from ISP dynamically.</p>
<p><B>Primary IPv6 DNS</B> - Enter the DNS IPv6 address in colon-hexadecimal notation provided by your ISP.</p>
<p><B>Secondary IPv6 DNS</B> -  Enter another DNS IPv6 address in colon-hexadecimal notation provided by your ISP.</p>

<p><B>Note:</B> If you get Address not found error when you access a Web site, it is likely that your DNS servers are set up improperly. You should contact your ISP to get DNS server addresses.</p>
<p><B>Get IPv6 with Unicast DHCP</B> - A few ISPs' DHCP servers do not support the broadcast applications. If you can't get the IPv6 Address normally, you can choose Unicast. (You generally need not to check this option).</p>
<P><B>Configure the IPv6 parameters of LAN:</B></P>

<ul>
<lI><B>IPv6 Address Assign Type</B> - <B>SLAAC</B>(Stateless address autoconfiguration) and <B>DHCPv6</B>(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6) Server.</lI>
<lI><B>IPv6 Address Prefix</B> -  The Prefix of IPv6 Address.</lI>
<lI><B>Release Time</B> - The Release Time is the length of time a network user will be allowed to keep connecting to the Router with the current DHCPv6 Address. Enter the amount of time, in seconds, that the DHCPv6 address will be "leased". The time range is 1~691200 seconds. The default value is 86400 seconds.</lI>
<lI><B>LAN IPv6 Address</B> - Display the LAN IPv6 Address. </lI>
</ul>
<p><B>Note</B> : Tunnel 6to4 is depended on IPv4 connection, when IPv4 is connected and the 6to4 tunnel is created, the LAN port will advertise an IPv6 prefix in format "2002:<IPv4 Address>:1::/64" and the prefix you have configed in LAN port is disabled.  </p>
<P>Click the <B>Save</B> button to save your settings.</p>
